# 7-Days-Interview-Revision-Data-Analyst
# 7 Days Interview Revision – Data Analyst (Python, SQL, Excel)

This repository contains a **7-day structured interview revision plan** for Data Analyst roles.

It is intentionally written assuming:
- The reader knows **nothing**
- The reader may **freeze in interviews**
- The reader needs **clear recall, not deep theory**

This is not a learning-from-scratch course.
This is an **interview survival and confidence rebuilding plan**.

---

## Who This Is For

This repository is suitable for:
- Candidates with Python/SQL/Excel exposure who go blank in interviews
- Freshers and working professionals preparing for Data Analyst roles
- Anyone who wants a **clear, limited, interview-safe scope**

If you follow this properly, you should be able to:
- Write basic Python code without freezing
- Convert simple business questions into SQL queries
- Explain Excel formulas logically
- Answer interview questions with structure

---

## How to Use This Repository (Important)

For every topic, follow this exact process:

1. Write notes by hand (do not just read)
2. Type the code/query yourself (no copy-paste)
3. Explain the logic aloud in simple words

Reading alone will not help.
Typing + explaining is mandatory.

## Final Note

You do not need to know everything.
You need to explain **what you know** clearly and calmly.

Seven days of focused, honest revision is better than months of scattered preparation.
